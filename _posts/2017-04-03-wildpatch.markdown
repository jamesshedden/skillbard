The Wild Patch project has been developed by the South Yare Wildlife Group to encourage householders and landowners to consider how they might manage their gardens or other spaces to be more wildlife friendly.

We made music and sound for this 3 minute animation explaining how those with gardens can help.

Directed by Phoebe Halstead and Matt King
