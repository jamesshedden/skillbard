We helped Nexus Studios realise an Augmented Reality first at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. Through 5G Samsung devices, fans could look out onto the pitch to see 80ft tall holograms of the Dallas Cowboys players as well as play a half-time AR game, facing-off a giant robot. Skillbard supported 'dem boys' the best way we know: with some bustin' beats and explosive sounds that bring the game to life.
