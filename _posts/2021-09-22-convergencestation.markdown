"Just beneath the surface of Convergence Station there lies a cosmic mystery—a mystery of four forgotten women and a gateway to the infinite”

A series of 6 animated shorts as part of Meow Wolf's Convergence Station, a shopping-mall-sized immersive art experience in Denver, CO.

For this project we were tasked with creating fantastical sound design for the character of Numina, a psychedelic 6th Dimensional being who warps her surroundings and learns to mimic the other sounds she hears throughout the series. We also created sound design and vocalisations for an ancient mech who is awoken from their slumber.
