A loveable guide to the redwood forest, Wol is a mixed reality AI-enabled experience for Meta VR headsets and mobile devices.

Wol joins you in your space through an AR portal which opens a door to the redwood forest. As an AI-enabled owl, Wol is ready to have a natural conversation with you about the plants on the forest floor, the lifecycle of a tree or really anything you'd like to discussâ€¦

We created music cues, immersive forest sounds and character foley to bring Wol and the experience to life.
