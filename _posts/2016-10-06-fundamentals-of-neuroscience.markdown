Music for Harvard X’s course Fundamentals Of Neuroscience. Fundamentals Of Neuroscience is a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that runs for three years and is available for free from Harvard X.

This was Harvard's first multi-media MOOC. It incorporated documentaries, animations and interactive elements to create a rich and engaging learning experience.

Being a three-year course a great deal of music and audio was required so only a selection can be presented here. The video above is a selection of the music of module 1, accompanied by random shots from lessons.
