We created sound for this trailer for Joe Sparrow's latest comic Homunculus, incorporated the music of the IBM 7094, which in 1961 wowed the world by being the worlds first [singing computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIwhx3NQSLg), inspiring the dying words of HAL in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Homunculus is available from Short Box.
