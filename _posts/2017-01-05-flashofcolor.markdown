A Flash of Color is a 6-minute Virtual Reality hypnosis journey through an abstract cloudscape and cityscape. Designed in collaboration with Harvard medical school, the project premiered at the prestigious chart art fair in Copenhagen and was featured at the industry-defining MUTEK conference in Montréal, Canada. Our "breakthrough" audio work was featured in advertising’s shoot and post magazine as well as DAZED Digital.

Unfortunately, being a VR installation, a video of the piece is unavailable online.
