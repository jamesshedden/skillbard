Sound and music* for New Year, a 9-minute animated short set over two time periods. 

In 1999 a boy becomes obsessed with the Y2K bug; In the distant future a girl is learning to be a priest in a religion based upon the ‘artefacts’ left behind by the boy.

Ravaged by millennia of climate breakdown, Britain is underwater. But Simon's ramblings and football stickers inspire a faith where the heat of the earth is respected and 90s Man United midfielder Nicky Butt is worshiped as a God.

Written and directed by Diana Gradinaru & Rory Waudby-Tolley.
*Hymn by Paul Devlin
