We were asked by Motoko to create music and sound for a series of 16 animations to be shown in the classrooms of The Hague’s primary schools. Entiteld “De Haagse Ladekast” (The Hague’s Drawer), these animations will be played on a smartboard at the beginning of a lesson in arts and culture.

You can watch the whole series [here](http://www.motoko.tv/en/production/animation/cultuuronderwijs-op-zijn-haags/)
