“There’s a musical sequence in Genesis Noir which rivals the best in recent video game memory.”<br>

Genesis Noir is a critically acclaimed video game for PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One set before, during, and after The Big Bang. To save your love, you must stop the expansion of the universe.
 
An adventure game with an emphasis on exploration, simple interactions, and generative art, Genesis Noir is around six hours of gameplay.

Its beautiful jazz score [is] entrancing”<br>
		<b>~Washington Post</b>
        </blockquote>

To bring our compositions to life, we recorded a jazz quintet, a choir, a shakuhachi flute and a 30-piece string orchestra, producing several hours of reactive, interactive, generative and incidental music assets as well as creating immersive sound design, recording foley and casting voice actors. Everything you hear in the game… 

We collaborated with the dev team to design and implement the music systems in the game, using FMOD middleware and Unreal Engine.

The soundtrack ‘Big Bang: Music from the Universe of Genesis Noir’ will soon be available on luxury double vinyl from [Iam8bit](https://www.iam8bit.com){:target="_blank"}.
