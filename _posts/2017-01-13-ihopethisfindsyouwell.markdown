This piece is mixed binaurally so headphones are recommended.

I Hope This Finds You Well is an audio piece by Bedwyr Williams as part of his solo show The Gulch at The Barbican Centre in London. This playful piece imagines the internal dialogues of the people that use the Barbican's public spaces as their personal office, listening in on the water cooler conversations they cannot have. Played from dummy laptops and touchscreen devices, visitors could plug in their own headphones and enter an alternative reality of The Barbican.
