An All Encompassing Light â€“ Chloe White. Short documentary made as part of BFI Doc Next Media Lab. Screened at Open City film festival and distributed online by Aeon Films.

A 20 minute documentary which details the experience of Lee, now in his 80s, when the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The film touches on themes of memory, and loss, and poses the question: how we can move forward with our lives when we hold such painful memories?

Original Score.
