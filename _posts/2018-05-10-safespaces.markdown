We created sound design for this little delight by Alex Grigg.

WeTransfer presents: Safe Spaces with Trevor Noah.
"Safe spaces have become very controversial, but Trevor Noah can't see what all the fuss is about. At The New York Timesâ€™ Get With The Times event at Northwestern University, the comedian and host of The Daily Show explained why he's fascinated by the whole discussion."
This film was commissioned by the fine folks at WeTransfer as part of their WePresent initiative.
