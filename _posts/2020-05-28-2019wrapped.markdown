In December 2019, as part of their annual "Wrapped" campaign Spotify gave their users a chance to look back on the past ten years of music and culture.

Having worked on the Wrapped 2018 campaign, we were asked to come back and create music and sound design that could be used on hundreds of different marketing assets worldwide.

Produced by Hornet.
