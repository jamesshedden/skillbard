In December 2019, as part of their annual "Wrapped" campaign Spotify gave their users a chance to look back on the past ten years of music and culture.

After having worked on the previous years campaign, we were asked once again to create music and sound design that would support hundreds of different executions worldwide.

Produced by Hornet.
