Hello!

Skillbard Studio is a friendly team of composers and sound designers based in London. We have experience in film, television, games, sound art, pop music, sonic branding and all-out having a good time with sound.

Each new task is approached with an open mind and a desire to challenge ourselves to do something fresh. Memorable music, stand-out sounds.

We integrate a host of music making and sound bending skills to work seamlessly through each step in achieving your vision. From imagining to scoring to performing to recording to delivering. We handle all kinds of projects, conception through to completion.

On top of our years of composition & sound for media, between us we offer a diverse background of professional and personal experiences in writing, producing, performing and releasing in our respective pop acts as well as directing music videos, TV brand-spots and touring the world performing visuals to accompany live music. This is how we’ve developed such intuition when it comes to how image and sound interact.

If you've got a project that needs the Skillbard treatment just sling us a [e-mail](mailto:oswald@skillbard.com) and we’ll hop right to it!
