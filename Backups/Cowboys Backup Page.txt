We helped Nexus Studios realise an Augmented Reality first at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. Through Samsung S10 5G phones, fans could see huge holograms of the Dallas Cowboys players inside and outside of the stadium. Inside the stadium, fans played Time Tackle, the half-time AR game where 80 ft tall Dallas Cowboys players faced-off giant robots. Skillbard supported 'dem boys' the best way we know: by implementing a dynamic soundtrack of bustin' beats and explosive sounds that brought the game to life.
